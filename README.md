# XFMultiBindingDemo
A demo of Xamarin Forms Multi Binding

For comparison and for those who don't like using converters and multi bindings I've added an example on how to create a property in the ViewModel that does the same thing.

Using multi binding requires using a converter that implement the logic of multi binding, while using a VM property that implement the same logic but require to notify that that property has changed when the other properties involved in the logic change their values.

Anyway, having the choice of using multi binding also in Xamarin Forms (same as WPF) is surely a good thing.
